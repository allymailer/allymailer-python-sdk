AllyMailer Python SDK — client for the AllyMailer transactional email Web API (Web API 1.90). How to integrate AllyMailer into an application comes first; the last section is about changing this package.

## Integrating AllyMailer

**On one of these frameworks, install its package instead of this SDK:** it brings the SDK and plugs it into the framework (configuration, client in the container, mailer, webhooks).

| Framework | Package | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| Django | `allymailer-django` | [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/allymailer/allymailer-django/blob/HEAD/AGENTS.md) |
| Flask | `allymailer-flask` | [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/allymailer/allymailer-flask/blob/HEAD/AGENTS.md) |
| FastAPI | `allymailer-fastapi` | [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/allymailer/allymailer-fastapi/blob/HEAD/AGENTS.md) |

### Install

```bash
pip install allymailer-python-sdk
```

Requirements: Python 3.8+. The API key goes to `ALLYMAILER_API_KEY`.

### Send an email

```python
import os

import allymailer
from allymailer.api.email import EmailSendRequest, MessageObject, MessageObjectRecipientsItem as Recipient
from allymailer.common import BodyObject

client = allymailer.client(os.environ["ALLYMAILER_API_KEY"])

response = client.email.send(EmailSendRequest(
    message=MessageObject(
        recipients=[Recipient.from_address("Alex <alex@example.com>")],
        from_email="shop@example.com",
        from_name="Shop",
        subject="Your order",
        body=BodyObject.from_html("<p>Hello, {{to_name}}! Your order has shipped.</p>"),
    ),
))
print(response.job_id)
```

Personalization, attachments, CC/BCC, scheduling, safe retries, error handling, the webhook handler and the sandbox flow: the recipes of [README.md](README.md#recipes).

### Rules for generated code

- Server-side only. Read the API key from `ALLYMAILER_API_KEY`; never put it in browser or mobile code, never commit it.
- Build the recipients and the body with the short forms of the SDK (the recipient from `"Name <email>"`, the name goes to `to_name`; per-recipient metadata; the HTML / text body), as in "Send an email" and the README recipes, not with hand-built nested objects.
- Base URL `https://cp.allymailer.com/ua/transactional/api/v1`; every method is POST with a JSON body; auth header `X-API-KEY`. The SDK does all of it.
- First email without DNS: `domain/get-sandbox-domain` → `confirmed-email/create` (the user clicks the link within 48 hours) → `email/send` from `noreply@<sandbox-domain>` to the confirmed address. Account API key only; up to 10 confirmed addresses, 100 emails a day. The domain is deleted 31 days after it was created: the next `domain/get-sandbox-domain` call creates a new one with another name, so read the name from the response, never hardcode it.
- Never ship a sandbox domain as the production sender (it is not in `domain/list`); read `from_email` from config. Production needs a verified domain: `domain/get-dns-records` → DNS records (verification TXT as is, DKIM TXT `v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=<dkim>` on `<selector>._domainkey`, CNAME `_dmarc` → the `dmarc` field; SPF `include:spf.allymailer.com` is not in the response) → `domain/validate-verification-record`, `domain/validate-dkim` → `domain/list`.
- Set `message.idempotence_key` on retryable sends; retry network errors, `429` and `5xx` with backoff, not other errors unchanged. Up to 500 recipients and 10 MB per request with the attachments in base64 (a third larger than the files); always `body.html` or `body.plaintext`.
- Delivery events via webhook (`webhook/set`), not polling. Check the `auth` field of every notification (MD5 of the raw request body with the `auth` value replaced by the API key) and answer 401 to a wrong one. Answer 200 within 3 seconds and process the events from a queue, otherwise the request is repeated every 10 minutes for 24 hours; take at least 5 parallel requests of up to 100 events each; deduplicate.
- Keep the default unsubscribe and tracking behaviour; changes go through AllyMailer support.
- Do not invent methods or fields. Check [docs/](docs/) of this package, the [API reference](https://docs.allymailer.com.ua/ua/web-api-ref) or [llms.txt](https://docs.allymailer.com.ua/llms.txt).

### Errors

Every method throws `ApiError` when the request fails: the HTTP status (0 for a network error or a timeout), the [API error code](https://docs.allymailer.com.ua/ua/web-api-ref#api-errors) and the message.

```python
# client created as above
from allymailer import ApiError

try:
    client.system.ping()
except ApiError as e:
    # http_status is 0 for a network error or a timeout
    print(e.http_status, e.error_code, e.message)
```

## Working on this repository

- **Generated code.** The whole package is generated by the AllyMailer team from the AllyMailer Web API OpenAPI spec (Web API 1.90): sources, docs, README.md and this file. Do not hand-edit it: the next release replaces the content of this repository. Report problems and requests in the issues of this repository (https://github.com/allymailer/allymailer-python-sdk).
- **Build and check:**

  ```bash
  python -m pip install -e .
  ```

- **Source label.** Every request carries the query parameter `platform=python-sdk.1.1.2`, added in one place, the shared request client (`ApiClient`); a package built on this SDK puts its own label in front: `<package>.<version>,python-sdk.1.1.2`.
- **Tests.** Before a release the generator builds and lints the package and runs every example of docs/ and of this file against a mock of the API: no real API key, no real sends.
- **Release.** The version (1.1.2 in pyproject.toml) and the tag `v1.1.2` come from the generator; README.md states the Web API version the release was generated from.
- **Secrets.** Never commit API keys; the examples read `ALLYMAILER_API_KEY` from the environment.
